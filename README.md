# Convenience scripts for my personal use.

Over many years of working on linux and unix systems, I've tried hard not to become too dependent on my own custom aliases or scripts. That has forced me learn the standard commands better. More importantly, it's helped me be comfortable when I need to work on a server that's not "mine" for some quick troubleshooting.

Despite my best efforts, I've slowly accumulated a small list of personal tools, many of which have become muscle memory, especially since switching from Windows to a macbook where the shell is so easily accessible and so well integrated.

I'm posting them here for two reasons:
- To share them with others.
- To make them easier for me to pull down to a new server.

# Disclaimers

You can find faster, more powerful, more secure, more reliable replacements for everything here, especially if you have privileges to install new programs on your system.

Some of these are pretty old, and specific to my current or old environments. I'm not making much effort yet to generalize them. If you want to use them, you might have to hardcode different paths to suit your environment.

Most of these are good enough for a sane system that's under your control. You wouldn't have to try very hard to break them though, for example by creating crazy filenames.
